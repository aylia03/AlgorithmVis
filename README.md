# Algorithm Visualizer 
## Description 
- This is a simple Sorting Algorithm Visualizer, built with JavaFX and Gradle.
- It shows all the "classic" sorting algorithms with a highlight function
- you can input personalized data
- you can change the speed of the animation
## Next steps
- implement a stepper
- work on the gui
- implement graph algorithms (like BFS, DFS)
